### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.
**I added this paragraph as a learning project.  I forked octocat/Spoon-Knife to my own github repo jdpavek/Spoon-Knife.  Then in VSCode, using GitLens, I cloned jdpavek/Spoon-Knife.  With GitLens I openned this file and now will try to commit it and the request a pull.  This is mostly trial and error and I wonder if I will get feedback to let me know if my process makes sense or if there is a better way to work with submitting changes to a repo.  As I am learning VSCode and using the VSCode docs, I'd like to submit potenial changes to the documentation. **


Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.
